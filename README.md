Project 2 by RetroWebWizards

This website is a redesign for the Global Cyber Security Initiative (GCSI), which is an annual conference to help IIT students acquire more knowledge about the Cyber Security field. We essentially created four different pages: Agenda, About, Contact Us, and Login pages. Below is more specifc information pertanining to each page:
- Agenda Page: Displays GCSI schedule and information about the event
- About Page: Explains how the GCSI was founded, and how it has developed over the past few years 
- Contact Us Page: Allows users to get in touch with the GCSI organizers
- Login Page: Ensures that users can stay updated with the GCSI Conference.

Additionally, it's important to note the purpose of our forked repositories. They were initially created so that every team member can work on assigned tasks individually before pushing final changes to the main repository.
